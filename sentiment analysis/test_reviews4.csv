Great item and easy to use. Very helpful and entertaining,2018-01-05T00:00:00.000Z,5
Excellent product. Turns on and off supported devices by asking it. Live walking into a room and asking Alexa to turn on a light. Poof it‚Äôs done. Or locking and unlocking the front door. Arming and disarming my security system. If you‚Äôre looking to turn your house into a smarthome I strongly recommend the Amazon Echo Plus,2018-01-28T00:00:00.000Z,5
Received an Echo Plus as a Christmas present. Absolutely love it. We went back & purchased a Dot & more light bulbs.,2018-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,5
Salesman told me the big one was better so I bought it. My daughter gave me the small one for Christmas. Does the same thing. Salesmen are apparently undertrained or a bunch of liars!,2018-01-21T00:00:00.000Z,4

"The Echo Plus was demonstrated for us at Best Buy. We were a bit skeptical but bought to check it out. Wow! are we impressed! We tell it to turn on and turn off our lights in the living room, family room, and bedroom. Also it can dim the lights more than once. Need the local weather forecast, just ask. Want to listen to Christmas music? Yes, again. Want to know the distance to someplace or the population of some city or country, yes! We're still discovering what it can do and it seems limitless. Absolutely love this!!",2017-12-15T00:00:00.000Z,5

"I've had an Amazon Echo and Dot for over a year now. I really wanted to develop the Smart Device usage around my house and when the upgraded Echo i just had to have it. It is a great device. I use the drop in feature to communicate with others in the house, especially when they are upstairs, without having to yell. The smart hub is amazing. Attaching to smart devices is much more seamless than with the 1st gen echo. Just got it so time will tell, but the 2nd gen Echo devices are worth it.",2017-12-23T00:00:00.000Z,5
Works great with WeMo and Philips Hue. Great sound and voice recognition.,2017-12-08T00:00:00.000Z,4

Bought this Echo for my wife. She loves how just by speaking she can listen to any type of music. It sounds pretty good too.,2017-12-20T00:00:00.000Z,5
I purchased my Eco for the holidays. It took me considerable time to get minimally operational. It is rather complex to hook up to other devises. So far it is only hooked up to my Dot. I wish there were more varieties of ways to learn how to use it. I am not nearly able to make use of it yet. But...it does look exciting if I ever get there.,2018-01-18T00:00:00.000Z,4
The built in hue allows the echo plus to automatically search and finds connectable devices. The larger speaker area assists in better sound and the alexa to hear my voice!!,2018-01-13T00:00:00.000Z,5
I love Alexa...She has become my best friend. Thanks,2018-04-18T00:00:00.000Z,5

No regrets on this one!",2018-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,5
"I gave the Echo 5 stars but I like Amazon products and ultimately the product is good..however, I use Cree smart light bulbs in my house and bought this Echo for the built in Hub to try and eliminate the extra hub space in my house..but the built in hub of the Echo Plus isn‚Äôt compatible at this time with Cree light bulbs..so I had to return it and wait for now and stick with my regular Echo and Echo Dot‚Äôs.",2018-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,5

We never received the light bulb. Very happy with Alexa just not happy that the bulb was not sent.,2018-01-08T00:00:00.000Z,4
It has very limited use without adding on expensive Apps or adding more wireless speakers. I am considering returning the merchandise,2017-12-23T00:00:00.000Z,3
Bought this for my son and one for my husband and me. So easy to set up. Very helpful. Doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of space.,2017-12-09T00:00:00.000Z,4
"When I used to think of amazon echo I think flimsy sounds, Amazon Echo was more of ECHO-Ing, tin can complex... at least from what I have experienced with my friends echos. Echo Plus you ask... Not so much!!! This device has such excellent sound!! One of the best devices I have ever purchased! If I could I would have these all over my house. Forget the dot and the echo 2nd gen. Echo plus is the way to go!!! Beautiful device, sounds is second to none!",2018-02-02T00:00:00.000Z,5
"Went to my local Best Buy and a friendly employee greed me and ask me if I needed any help, I ask about the echo and the google assistance and the employee explained the pros and cons of each device and even show me other ones. With his help I end up pickin the new echo Plus (Alexa) and I absolutely LOVE IT! I really like the Phillips Hue Bulb included and I am definitely going to buy more! My customer experience was really great and I am very grateful for the courtesy, knowledge and the time this employee offered me.

"Purchased the Echo Plus after reading that the new generation had been upgraded by improving the sound and integration of a controller. For the price provided, I thought that the deal was a good value. I have the first generation unit as well. A quick comparison of the two from a sound, look, etc perspective really didn't lead me to think that there was any noticeable sound improvement nor improved aesthetics. At least the price for the unit has come down quite a bit and the addition of Philips bulb for 'free' was a smart move.Overall, I think that the unit is a good purchase for beginning some home automation projects.",2017-12-08T00:00:00.000Z,4
I was really reluctant buying Alexa but I‚Äôve read so much about this item that I bought the package (Alexa and Phillips bulb) and have been amazed with how well it works.,2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z,4
Worked right out of the box easy set up and operation,2018-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,5
Love the thing. My wife uses it daily. Should have bought it a long time ago. It even controls our Hue lights.,2017-12-08T00:00:00.000Z,5
Purchased the echo after hearing it at a neighbors. Good quality speaker for the small size.,2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,5
The system is able to react quickly to the verbal directions. It even is able to pickup voices across the room and seems to capture the commands accurately even when spoken quickly.,2017-12-08T00:00:00.000Z,4
Got one for my daughter last year and she loves it.,2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,4

I really like the echo plus and the hue light bulb does work on the echo plus but I had to buy a bridge from Phillips in order to schedule on off schedule times for the light. I thought the Echo Plus was like a bridge but I guess it isn‚Äôt.,2017-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,2

"From her jokes, rapping and everyday new fact Alexa is awesome. Its super easy to pull out your phone to check the weather but i honestly never did and would always be surprised when i walked outside with whatever it is that day. But every morning i ask alexa whats the weather and she gives me an in depth review for that day and the rest of the week. There are tons of skills for Alexa most useful some random. But shes a must try. Also plus about the echo plus is if you want to start a smart home you dont need a hub like the other echo pieces. You can just buy some compatible smart bulbs.",2018-01-18T00:00:00.000Z,5
You need to have Amazone prime in order to have music,2018-01-26T00:00:00.000Z,4
Works great. Can‚Äôt wait to find all it can do for me.,2017-12-26T00:00:00.000Z,5

Great product easy to use and would recommend to anyone,2017-12-08T00:00:00.000Z,5
I really like this product. My Son got us the Alexa Show for Christmas and I wanted one that would turn on lights and other items. So we purchased this because it has the bridge so that you can use it with the Phillips Hue lights. It works great. I have the Show in the kitchen and I have the Echo in my bedroom. I love that it has a great built in speaker. I can have it play my music in both rooms at the same time.....,2018-02-16T00:00:00.000Z,5

I've got to go and get started with the set-up.,2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,5
I mainly bought the Echo plus for my kids but I‚Äôm using it more than they do. Excellent product!!,2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,5
"I purchased this, in addition to several other Alexa products, because I wanted the hub to connect several smart home devices. So far it has been pretty easy to set up and use. I'm happy with the sound also.",2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z,5
As advertised. Easy set up and integration. Haven't tried to use the hub yet but it is limited in the number of products it works with compared to Samsung Smartthing or Wink 2.,2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z,5
Love the bigger speaker and the quality of sound with this product. Like turning on bedroom light with Alexa.,2018-01-14T00:00:00.000Z,5
"I usually unplug it but when I plug it back in, it is always difficult to get it reconnected to the internet for some reason.",2017-12-20T00:00:00.000Z,4
I purchased this to pair with my other echo while I enjoy my other 2 echoes I must say there is a noticeably difference with the echo plus and best buy had it at a remarkable price better than amazon so it was win they amped up the speaker,2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,5

"I‚Äôm a big Apple consumer all around but after tons of research and testing, I went to alexa over Siri (Apple home kit) to make my full home a smart house.",2017-12-15T00:00:00.000Z,5
"Like the idea of having a built-in hub to control other smart home devices as we get them.Sound quality is marginally better, but we didn't buy Echos as audiophiles...but for background music and it's perfect for that.My only complaint to date is that we have to accounts in our home and Amazon Echo must have one or the other. That makes it frustrating for the other user (particularly when playing configuring music to play in all rooms).",2017-12-18T00:00:00.000Z,4
I love my Echo so much. I have my lights and front door deadbolt hooked up to it. I play music from it all the time and ask Alexa about the traffic and weather. I would recommend the Echo to everyone.,2018-01-06T00:00:00.000Z,5
Echo plus is able to play music and response whatever answer by itself. It also equip with bluetooth so I can pair to another more powerful speaker. It's so convenient to ask/request without touch anything. The response time is acceptable but you need to speak out your question right after calling Alex or it won't wait.,2017-11-30T00:00:00.000Z,5

"I never thought that buying this product was such a great step up. Really makes watching a movie and turning on the TV so easy, really works well with my harmony hub. Love the way I can control all the lights. Looking forward to all the add ons, I can purchase.",2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z,5

I have an original Gen 1 Echo that has been relocated to My Bedroom by simply unplugging and Plugging back in!Now that I have the Gen 2 Echo Plus in my Living Room and set up to work seamlessly with my Gen 1 I could not be happier.

"Friend received Amazon Echo as gift & is enjoying it. I researched & decided on Echo Plus as I wanted capability to use to control home lighting. Absolutely love this product! It controls lights in several rooms as well as outdoor lighting. Other features, weather, news briefs, traffic are fun, but the lighting control did it for me.",2018-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,5
"Amazon and Philips Hue work great together. very easy setup. The only drawback is using these bulbs on a non-Philips dimmer switch. The bulbs flicker a bit, even when it's set to full on",2018-01-14T00:00:00.000Z,5
"This is a neat little toy. It‚Äôs pretty cool that I‚Äôm able to turn the lights on and off, by talking to Alexa.",2018-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,5

super cool very interesting i have a lot of fun with it,2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z,5
I bought the echo plus that is supposed to come with a Phillips Hue light bulb. I got the echo plus but no light bulb. I contacted Elite Plus and after a very long go around was told I would get a $20 credit on the best buy gift card that I used as part of the payment. I was told it would take up to 15 days to get the credit (why so long). I was also told I would get an email stating info about the credit. I still have not gotten the email. I have my doubts if I will ever see the $20 put back on my gift card. This is the second time I have ordered a bundle from Best Buy online and have received the main item but not the bundled items. Last year I bought a friend a PS4 bundle for XMas. They got the PS4 but none of the included games. I had to call and get the games sent out separately. I don't know what is the problem is with their online ordering when bundled items are included. I am getting very wary of ordering anything online with Best Buy that I will get what I ordered on time. BTW... I really like the Echo Plus. Just not the screw up with the shipping and the initial solution I was offered when I called customer service.,2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z,5

"The Echo Plus is a fantastically easy to use smarthome hub. It is easy to setup, fast and responsive, has a ton of capabilities that are expanding daily, and looks and sounds great. I currently use mine to manage my smart ‚Äúthings‚Äù like light bulbs, lamps, smart switches, and even my robot vac. It has made automating a lot of what I do daily a breeze and has simplified my life where I didn‚Äôt know it needed to be simplified!Definitely worth the extra money to go with the Plus over the Echo or the Dot.",2018-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,5

I have the original Echo and just purchase the Echo Plus. Better speakers and can act as a hub for the Philips Hue Bulbs without having to purchase another hub. Very satisfied with its performance.,2017-12-08T00:00:00.000Z,5
Easy setup. They are adding new commands every week it seems. Still has some work till it is fully functional.,2018-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,4
They make it seem like you can pretty much ask anything to Alexa but she never knows anything. It is very non responsive at times too.,2018-01-26T00:00:00.000Z,3

"She's becoming part of the family, but, the Echo Plus is not much different (that I have discovered, yet, anyway) than the Echo 2nd generation. I haven't had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know. I have had the Echos (Plus, Echos-2nd generation, and Dot) about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality, but, we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume. The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus, further. I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale. We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs.",2018-01-13T00:00:00.000Z,5
Love it along with the Fire Stick works great. Works great with the voice,2017-12-25T00:00:00.000Z,5
Alexa in itself needs lots of improvement but with philips hue and smart plugs you can have a lot of fun settings,2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,4
