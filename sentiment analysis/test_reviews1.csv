I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.,2017-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,3
This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!,2017-06-06T00:00:00.000Z,5

"I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last.",2017-11-02T17:33:31.000Z,5
Solid entry level Kindle. Great for kids. Gifted for a kid of my friend and they love to use it to read more than their iPads. battery is good but higher model is a bit better.,2018-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,5

"I ordered this for my daughter, as I have the black paperwhite, and I love it. I read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down, or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback, with this I can throw it in my bag and read anywhere. Its light weight, easy to use, the battery life lasts for weeks, which makes it an all around awesome device. My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for E-Readers, so she can now download books for free from school! You can also download your own public library app (if your county offers that) and read free from there as well. You can shop for e-books straight from the device through Amazon.com.",2017-12-20T17:38:23.000Z,5

If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy.,2016-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,5

"I was looking for a kindle whitepaper. I saw online for $80. What a deal. I ordered it on line and picked it up in the store. I got it home and couldn't adjust the brightness. After a lengthy time with online customer service I called customer service. After 20 minuets with speaking to a female Elmer Fud that doesn't speak english well I figured I would just return it. Although it looks Identical to the $120 model, you can not adjust the brightness. That would have been good information before I bought it.",2017-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,1
This is a nice bare-bones reading device. Easy to set up and use. My greatest issue is that it isn't back lit so it can't be used w/o a light on in the room. Returning it an purchasing a paperwhite instead.,2017-03-22T15:18:54.000Z,4

"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books.",2017-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,4

"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet.",2017-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,5
"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!",2016-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,5

"I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update.",2017-01-08T00:00:00.000Z,5
"This is a great way to read books on the go. There's no backlight, so reading in darker rooms may be hard. But it's affordable and portable and a great way to take all your books with you.",2017-11-30T00:00:00.000Z,5
"I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle.",2017-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,5
i bought this as a backup. I am currently using the same headphone.,2018-01-06T00:00:00.000Z,4
"We got the Kindle for our daughter who accompanied us to try out the two Kindle models. We were willing to buy either one and we assumed she would want the more expensive one with the backlighting feature. But as she tried both, she gravitated with certainty toward the basic model. ""Why would U want to read in the dark?"" She said. As the weeks and months have gone by, she says she's completely happy with the basic Kindle, it's exactly what she wanted. Perfect.",2017-12-21T00:00:00.000Z,5
"Good, able to read under bright sunlight conditions too",2018-01-11T00:00:00.000Z,4

"Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up.",2017-02-02T00:00:00.000Z,5
"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models.",2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z,5

Easy to use and it arrived exactly as described. Good beginner device for youngsters who want a device to read from.,2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z,4
Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn't backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant.,2016-10-30T23:02:29.000Z,1
My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.,2017-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,4
"For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire.",2017-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,3
"It is still the best device for buying books and reading them. However, go with kindle paperwhite if you read books in dark places.",2018-01-23T00:00:00.000Z,5

"My wife loves it, replaces a Kindle from like 2003.",2018-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,5
"It's small, light, and easy to read from. I just wish I would have spent the extra 30 bucks and got the paperwhite. The more i use this one the more I wish I had the option of a backlight. If you're on the fence as I was, go with the paperwhite! However if the backlight is not an issue, this device is great and I would recommend it.",2017-06-30T23:22:13.000Z,4
This device is good for entry level reader only in daylight.Its doesnot support reading in dark. To read in dark you will have to purchase a light or cover case with light attached. I either case it will put a lot of strain in your eyes.,2018-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,3
"I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don't mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle.",2016-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,4

"I especially like the Amazon has a system to convert pdf to kindle format. Some of the things I read (journal articles) are in pdf format and I can email them to my kindle email and it shows up on my kindle with kindle format (larger text). You can find your kindel email at your account information. Only thing, I would have like a screen little larger.",2017-11-17T00:00:00.000Z,4

"I love my Kindle! I'm back to reading so much more often as I always have several books with me at all times! At first it surprised me that this version doesn't have a back light and you need a light to read, but I actually like it now as I don't get the eye strain like I do when using my phone.",2018-02-19T00:00:00.000Z,4
"I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes.",2018-01-21T00:00:00.000Z,3
